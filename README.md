# QuizApp
Worked with open trivia database API to create a quiz app. The application makes a request to the API so that you always get different questions each time.

A Score board is also displayed to show the user their current score.

Once the 10 questions set are over, the user is informed that they have completed the challenge.

Used the html module to unescape the HTML entitities in the questions fetched from the API.
